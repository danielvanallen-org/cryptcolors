# Crypt Colors

The production version of this website is located at [https://cryptcolors.com](https://cryptcolors.com).

Learn about public key cryptography by mixing colors of paint as an example of a one-way function.

Designed for groups of three, two users ("Alice" and "Bob") can each choose a private color, combine it with a shared base color, and share the resulting public colors openly in front of the third user ("Eve").

The two users will then be able to mix the public and private colors to arrive at a shared secret without the third user knowing the result.

This is a simplified version of how SSL/TLS is used to secure websites, by arriving at a shared secret to use for symmetric encryption.

This site is heavily inspired by the blog post at [https://maths.straylight.co.uk/archives/108](https://maths.straylight.co.uk/archives/108), with the goal of engaging learners with an interactive demonstration.
